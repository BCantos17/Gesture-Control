This is the final Project that both Andrew Chandradata and I worked on.

We created a program that uses the web camera available to detect hand gestures and use them as inputs for the computer

Moving the and left is Control + Shift + Tab
Moving the hand right is Control + Tab
Moving the hand up is Alt + Tab

To run this program, first you need to download the latest version of Python 2 as well as Open CV and then you can either use the the Python IDLE, go to handtracing.py and click run module or you can use your terminal and type "Python handtracing.py"
